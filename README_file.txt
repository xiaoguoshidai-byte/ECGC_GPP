Data Records:
The original ECGC_GPP dataset is at 0.05 degree and monthly scales, ranging from 80 °N to 60 °S. The entire earth land surface is divided into six continents under the Mercator projection.
The data are stored in network Common Data Form (NetCDF) files.
The units are all in g C m-2 d-1 with a scalar factor of 0.001.
ECGC_GPP data values are saved as int16 format and Nan values in the ECGC_GPP are filled with the value of -9999.
We provide one precise spatial resolution at 0.05 degree monthly scales with a longitude-latitude projection under WGS-1984 datum.

Code Records：
The code for data processing was written in Matlab2020a.
